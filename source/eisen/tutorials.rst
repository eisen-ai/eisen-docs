We are currently developing tutorials demonstrating and teching how to most effectively use Eisen. In particular,
we have made available a Google Colab Notebook showing the main capabilities of our software on a real-life use case
on a publicly available medical dataset obtained from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon challenge
http://medicaldecathlon.com.

Please visit https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aCvGYyADXPLxNqVRfFvbyN70WkMpdfDd to access the Colab Notebook
and try out Eisen on top of powerful GPUs.
